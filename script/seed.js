Pinch of salt. Cocoa powder or powdered sugar (for dusting). For the Heartless Garnish (optional): Black fondant or black candy melts. Edible gold or silver luster dust. Small heart-shaped cookie cutter',
            recipeInstructions: 'Prepare the Ganache: Place the chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat immediately. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let it sit for a minute to soften the chocolate. Gently whisk the mixture until the chocolate is fully melted and the ganache is smooth. Add the unsalted butter, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to the ganache. Mix until the butter is completely incorporated. Chill the Ganache: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, ensuring it touches the surface of the ganache to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate the ganache for about 2-3 hours, or until it firms up and is scoopable. Shape the Truffles: Once the ganache has chilled, use a small scoop or spoon to portion out small amounts of ganache. Roll the portions between your palms to create smooth truffle balls. Place them on a parchment-lined tray. Coat the Truffles: Roll the truffle balls in cocoa powder or powdered sugar, covering them completely. This gives them a rustic, Heartless-like appearance.
